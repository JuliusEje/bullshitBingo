# 📊 Meeting Bullshit Bingo

A humorous, accessible web app for meetings where too much is said – and too little gets done.

Create your personal bullshit bingo board with common business buzzwords like “quick win,” “leverage synergies,” or “we need to think big.” Perfect for online meetings, presentations, or workshops.
